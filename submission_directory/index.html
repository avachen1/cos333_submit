<P> At Princeton, the current pen-and-paper system for monitoring meal exchanges between eating clubs is inconvenient for everyone involved. Members don't know how many meal exchanges they have outstanding with their friends and club administrators spend hours manually tabulating meal exchanges at the end of each month. We're proposing a system where instead of using paper slips, students simply register their meal exchanges and guest meals online on our webapp. Students can receive updates on how many meal exchanges they have outstanding as well as how many guest meals they have left in the month. Eating clubs can edit memberships and club preferences, as well as view all exchanges online or by downloading a .csv file with all the computations done for them. Fewer lost slips of paper, fewer outstanding meal exchanges, fewer hours of manual tabulation. Everyone's a winner!

<!-- <P> Access a running version of our system here: <a href="www.princeton-mealxchange.com:8000/Xchange/">here</a>. You may log in using any of the eating clubs' names (not including spaces), with the password being the lowercase version of the eating club name (e.g. username: "Terrace", password: "terrace"). For administrative access, click <a href="www.princeton-mealxchange.com:8000/admin">here</a> and log in with the username "admin" and password "admin". -->
